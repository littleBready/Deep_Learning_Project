node_generator.py defines the class `Node`, and the function `generateNode`. 

generate\_node.py generates node for validation data, change the directory `BASE_DIR` in the code to desired directory.

generate\_edges.py generates edges from the nodes generated by generate\_node.py, first read from pickle file, and then generate the similarity based edges, and temporal based edges. The distance function is defined in function `temporal_distance` and `feature_distance`. 

generate\_nodes\_test\_data.py and generate\_edges\_test\_data.py are similar.
